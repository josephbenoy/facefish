# facefish
a different approach to facebook phishing pages 

Hi guys !
let me tell you something about facefish.

This project includes collection of facebook phishing pages that you can use to steal facebook passwords of others. This is really simple to use and probably works with 'non-tech savy victims'.

This phishing pages are really built for mobile devices and it won't go good with desktop and tablet devices.
